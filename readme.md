# Franzis X-MAS House as Code

The Advent calendar from Franzis was using MBlock for Coding, a graphical interface UI with code blocks. To have more flexibility/more control/be faster I moved this to c++.

The LEDs on the christmas tree are controlled via `dimLED`, the RGB LEDs from `rbgLED`. The doorbell has an interrupt that sets a flag in the melody to start it. Pressing it while playing will restart the music.
